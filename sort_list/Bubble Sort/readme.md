1. Bubble Sort:
- How it works: Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
- Best-case performance: O(n) (when the list is already sorted)
- Average and Worst-case performance: O(n²)
- Use case: It’s simple but inefficient for large datasets. Good for small datasets or educational purposes.
- Example: For a list [4, 3, 2, 1], it would perform 6 swaps in total, gradually moving the largest unsorted element to the end of the list.
