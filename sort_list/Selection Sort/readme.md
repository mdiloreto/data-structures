Selection Sort is a simple, comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted part. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Selection Sort works:

Key Steps in Selection Sort:
Start with an unsorted array: The algorithm works by dividing the array into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part is empty, and the unsorted part contains the entire array.

Find the minimum element: In each pass, the algorithm searches for the smallest (or largest, for descending order) element in the unsorted part of the array.

Swap with the first unsorted element: Once the minimum element is found, it is swapped with the first element of the unsorted part of the array. This moves the smallest element into the sorted part.

Move the boundary: After the swap, the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts is shifted by one element. The sorted part grows, while the unsorted part shrinks.

Repeat: Steps 2–4 are repeated until the entire array is sorted.

Example:
Let’s go through an example with the list [64, 25, 12, 22, 11] and sort it in ascending order using Selection Sort:

Step 1: The entire list is unsorted. Find the minimum element from [64, 25, 12, 22, 11] → The minimum is 11. Swap 11 with 64. The list becomes [11, 25, 12, 22, 64].
Step 2: Now, the sorted part is [11], and the unsorted part is [25, 12, 22, 64]. Find the minimum element from [25, 12, 22, 64] → The minimum is 12. Swap 12 with 25. The list becomes [11, 12, 25, 22, 64].
Step 3: The sorted part is [11, 12], and the unsorted part is [25, 22, 64]. Find the minimum element from [25, 22, 64] → The minimum is 22. Swap 22 with 25. The list becomes [11, 12, 22, 25, 64].
Step 4: The sorted part is [11, 12, 22], and the unsorted part is [25, 64]. Find the minimum element from [25, 64] → The minimum is 25. No swap is needed since it's already in place.
Step 5: The sorted part is [11, 12, 22, 25], and the unsorted part is [64]. Since only one element remains, the array is fully sorted.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n²)
Average Case: O(n²)
Worst Case: O(n²)
Despite its simplicity, Selection Sort is inefficient for large lists because it requires O(n²) comparisons and O(n) swaps in all cases. However, it is easy to implement and understand, making it a popular choice for educational purposes. Additionally, Selection Sort performs well on small lists and in scenarios where memory writes are more costly than comparisons, as it makes the minimal number of swaps (O(n) swaps).
