# Test 
You are given a string *s* consisting of lowarcase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacents and equial letters and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can 

Return the final strnig after all such dupliciate removals made. 

Example: 

- Input: s = "abbaca"
- Output: "ca"

# Follow up

What if instead of adjacent pairs (2) you would remove *k*-wise duplicates like: 

Example: 

- Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3 
- Output: "aa"
